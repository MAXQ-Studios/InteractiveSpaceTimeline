                    <h1>Development</h1>
                    <p>The R-7 was developed by the main rocket/missile organization of the Soviet Union, OKB-1, and would become the first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.</p>
                    <p>R-7, like its current Soyuz decedent, uses a series of boosters on the first stage to assist in ascent. The seperation of the boosters has been nicknamed the "Korolev Cross," named after the lead engineer, Sergei Korolev.</p>
                    <h1>Use</h1>
                    <h2>Missile</h2>
                    <p>The R-7 and its variants would be used as a major missile system of the USSR until it was phased out in 1968 cause it was not very good at being a missile</p>
                    <h2>Rocket</h2>
                    <p>A modified R-7 was used to launch Sputnik later the year of the first flight of the normal R-7. It would also evolve into Korolev's Soyuz rocket which varients of are still used today.</p>
